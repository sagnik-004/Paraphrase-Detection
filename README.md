# Paraphrase-Detection

This project implements a **paraphrase detection system** using a fine-tuned version of [Sentence-BERT (SBERT)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.10084). The model takes in **two sentences as input** and computes a **semantic similarity score between 0 and 1**, where values closer to 1 indicate higher likelihood of the sentences being paraphrases.

By leveraging SBERTâ€™s ability to generate high-quality sentence embeddings, this system provides an efficient way to measure semantic overlap between text pairs. Such a capability is useful in a variety of natural language processing applications, including **duplicate question detection, semantic search, information retrieval, and text clustering**.
